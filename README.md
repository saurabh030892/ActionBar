ActionBar
=========

Simplified implementation of action bar

IT includes :

1) ActionBar icon
2) ActionBar name, which is a spinner navigation with 4 options using adapter
3) ActionBar icons search with a search widget using adapter
4) second ActionBar icon location which opens new activity.
5) A parent button is also provided at action bar when location activity is opened.

This application is just to understand the different working aspect of ActionBar. 

CONTRIBUTERS CAN MODIFY it in a real aspect, it would be appreciated.
